1.9.2:

1.9.1:
(DONE): Filewatcher: Ensure that when the file is deleted and kept open, the user is prompted for save upon close		
(DONE): Filewatcher: User should only be prompted about file changes when the application has focus.	
(DONE): Filewatcher: When the user declines to reload a changed file, it should not prompt again
(DONE): Filewatcher: File deleted: If the user selects yes, it keeps asking and keeps adding asterisks		
(DONE): Filewatcher: File deleted: If the user selects no, it crashes because the document dictionary is modify during enumeration	
(DONE): BUG: new file saved with save as isn't marked as existing	
(DONE): Filewatcher: Saving the document changes which targets are selected (caused by filewatcher firing during save)
(DONE): Filewatcher: should prompt the user, when the file changes, if they want to reload it
(DONE): Filewatcher: Rewrite to use Application.Idle polling technique instead
(DONE): BUG: New project doesn't prompt for save on close.
(DONE): BUG: New project doesn't work.  Filewatcher failes.
(DONE): BUG: Errors when loading/saving a file are not caught
(DONE): Figure out why tabcompletion doesn't work on the xmlcontrol
(DONE): Figure out why folding doesn't work on the xmlcontrol
(DONE): Closing the app while running a build throws a "cannot access disposed object" in OutputWindow.WriteOutput
(DONE): Active document should be checked
(DONE): Clicking the menuitem shouldn't reload the document
(DONE): Window menu that lists all open tabs
(DONE): create it in the controller and pass it into the NAntDocument.  The window isn't the right place for it, but it's there
	    because it needs a control to synchronize the threading
(DONE): Add save all menu item and toolstrip button
(DONE): Closing multiple tabs that require saving works just like SharpDevelop (cancel is only valid for current document)
(DONE): Implement Run menuitem on the targets tree
(DONE): Implement tool tip on targets tree
(DONE): Add 'close all but this' menu item to tab right click
(DONE): Add 'save' menu item to tab right click	
(DONE): Add 'close all tabs' menu item to tab right click
(DONE): Add 'close other tabs' menu item to tab right click	
(DONE): Should save the locations of the toolstrips on the mainform	
(DONE): New Project code implementation

1.9.0:
(DONE): Update website to show that NAnt-Gui runs in .Net 2.0
(DONE): Merge the Dotnet-2.0 branch into the trunk
(DONE): Unsaved/New document should prompt for save on close of the app
(DONE): Unsaved/New document should prompt for save when the X on the dockpanel is clicked
(DONE): In general, reloading the document changes the cursor to 1,1
(DONE): Saving a file reloads it, which moves the cursor to 1,1
(DONE): Should only save the document, when running it, if it has changes
(DONE): Move SourceFile into NAntDocument, put the filesystem watcher on the DocumentWindow, 
		and remove all the save, saveas and load methods from NAntDocument
(DONE): Try to remove some of the redundant event handlers and use anonymous delegates instead	
(DONE): Add in a filewatcher for each file
(DONE): Undo and redo should be disabled if the document has nothing to undo/redo, enabled otherwise
(DONE): When the document changes, the undo/redo button states should be updated
(DONE): Loading the app twice shouldn't throw an 'Build file not found - [blank] was not found.'
(DONE): Thread the parsing of the build scripts on load
(DONE): Figure out if drag&drop not working on the actual documents is a limitation of the texteditor control (it is, you can drag and drop text and it is pasted)
(DONE): Ensure that drag&drop works on output, properties and targets windows too
(DONE): Bug: load app hit control-v, watch it crash
(DONE): Save the WordWrap state to the Settings class
(CANT): Make WordWrap Editor work (Not supported in the xmleditor control)
(DONE): Fix Dock settings being loaded on start
(DONE): Ensure that double-clicking a .build file makes it load in the app if the app is already loaded (as far as I can figure the commandline arguments are being overridden by the by the dockpanel.LoadXML)
(DONE): Make loading load all the previously loaded documents an option
(DONE): Store open files in settings and when NAnt-Gui is loaded, load all the previously loaded
(DONE): Fix Dock settings being loaded on start
(DONE): Split Word Wrap into WordWrap Output and WordWrap Editor
(DONE): Ensure that drag&drop works on the form
(DONE): Selecting different tabs doesn't update the property and target windows
(DONE): If you open a document, close it, then open it again the app crashes
(DONE): I think the maincontroller and the dockpanel need to be tied together.  If the document was put
  in the document window then the main controller wouldn't have to keep track of the selected document and 
  window.  The dock panel already keeps track of the "active document" or active tab.  Might need to be 
  restructured
(DONE): Move DockingConfig to the user folder instead of the application folder  
(DONE): Need right-click context menu in text editor
(DONE): Implement IEditControls on xmlcontrol (because scripteditor was removed)
(DONE): Hide Editor property in DocumentWindow.  Fully ecapsulate it.
(DONE): Add WinFormsUI docking to replace MagicLibrary	
(DONE): Use Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices to allow multiple files to open 
(DONE): Fix the build file because it doesn't work with <solution> anymore
(DONE): Allow only one instance of NAnt-Gui to load
(DONE): Allow additional files that are double-clicked to load in a new tab
(DONE): Converted ToolBar to ToolStrip
(DONE): Converted Main Menu to MenuStrip
(DONE): Converted StatusBar to StatusStrip
(DONE): Converted Context Menus to MenuStrip
(DONE - Already in there):  Write in documentation about having to copy the nant bin directory files to the NAnt-Gui Debug directory
(DONE): Change New to New flyout with New blank file and New NAnt Project
(DONE): Figure out how to get the tag completion (ie: type <wak> and </wak> appears) from Greg.XmlEditor
(DONE): Figure out why the folding doesn't work and completion
(DONE): Fix window settings being saved on exit and loaded on start

1.5.0:
(DONE): Change the way that NAntBuildScript.cs:LoadNonProjectProperty:134 works.  Right now it adds all
  properties from the Gui regardless of whether the property's value has change.  Only propertys 
  with changed values should be added.
(DONE): Clean up how property bag works.  AKA, the events should change the values of the properties and
  the Tag property of the propertyspec class can be removed as you don't need to store the actual 
  nant property in the propertybag.properties collection
(DONE): Multiple Tabs
	* Adjust right-click context menu on tabs so it only shows on tabs
	* Only allow one copy of a file to be loaded at a time
(DONE): Made sure NAnt-Gui works with .Net 2.0
(DONE): Reorder projects.  Add a Gui project and move the UI code into it
(CANCELLED: Didn't work): Modify the app.config file so that it points to the nant directory, then 
	modify the app and installer so that it loads the tasks from the nant directory instead of 
	having to have the nant bin directory copied into the nant-gui bin directory
(CANCELLED: SLiNgshoT is deprecated): Add SLiNgshoT tool window to tools menu

1.4.0:
(DONE) New build file functionality (test to make sure save, reload, build, either work, or ignored on new files)

PRE 1.4.0:
(DONE) Switch output windows to fixed-width font so NAnt output displays accurately
(DONE) Put scroll bars on the editor window
(DONE) Relatively reference nant for the prebuild step so it doesn't have to be in the path
(DONE) View output menuitem
(DONE) icon for output
(DONE) Move Menus into separate files
(DONE) Write MainFormMediator
(DONE) Enable drag and drop on the editor and tabs
(DONE) Fix copy and paste menu items (they only operate on text in the output window)
(CANCELLED: Non-standard behaviour) Add drag and drop text into the editor
(DONE) Make stop build menu item
(DONE) Hookup output and tabcontrol to mediator so it always knows which has focus for copy, wordwrap, paste, etc...
(DONE) Add cut, paste, and delete menuitems (diabled when output box has focus)
(DONE) Add copy, paste, undo, redo icons
(DONE) Create save output default initial dir reg key
(DONE) Modify the tab control so that it is hooked up to the tabchange event and figures out the selected tab then instead of always searching for the selected tab)
