Created a fork of Nant-GUI due to closing of Berlios platform and 
for being able to create an updated version, since the project looks
orphaned. Because I don't fully understand the complete project structure and 
references to  thirdparty components right now I simply added all components of 
the installation to the initial repository.

Subversion Repository:
Anonymous SVN Access via HTTP:
svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/nantgui/trunk 
Developer SVN Access via HTTPS: 
svn checkout https://developername@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/nantgui/trunk 

Ensure that you copy the Tools\nant-{version}\bin directory into your NAnt-Gui\bin\debug directory
when you first checkout the application from subversion.

You need a .Net C# 3.0 compiler to build the project
